# RNA-Seq-Pipeline
This RNA-Seq pipeline is designed to process, analyze, and quantify gene expression data efficiently. The key objectives of this pipeline are as follows:

1: Project Organization:
 Establish a structured directory to manage raw data, processed files, and results systematically.

2: Quality Control: 
Use tools like FastQC and MultiQC to assess the quality of raw sequencing data and summarize potential issues such as low-quality reads or adapter contamination.

3: Read Alignment: 
Map RNA-Seq reads to a reference genome using HISAT2, ensuring high accuracy in aligning sequencing reads to their genomic locations.

4: Data Summarization: 
Summarize alignment statistics using MultiQC to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the mapping process.

5: Gene Annotation: 
Incorporate genomic annotation data to link sequencing reads to known gene features, enabling downstream expression quantification.

6: Feature Counting: 
Use the FeatureCounts tool to quantify gene expression by counting reads mapped to exons and assigning them to corresponding gene IDs.

7: Data Filtering: 
Perform data preprocessing to remove unnecessary information and retain the most relevant expression data for further analysis.

8: Reproducibility: 
Automate key steps through scripts, ensuring that the pipeline is repeatable and adaptable for other RNA-Seq datasets.

This pipeline ultimately provides high-quality, normalized gene expression data for downstream analyses, such as differential expression analysis or pathway enrichment studies
